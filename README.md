Loan Amount Prediction – ML Capstone Project
Problem Statement

Banks need to estimate the loan amount a customer is likely to request or be eligible for based on their personal and financial information. Automating this process improves:

Loan approval efficiency

Customer experience

Risk management

This project uses Linear Regression to predict loan amounts for bank customers using historical credit risk data.
